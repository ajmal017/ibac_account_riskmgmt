InteractiveBrokers trading platform account risk management and equity curve charting

IB does not offer a good risk management platform for managing account equity, such as gain/loss, 
net liquidity data collection and presentation on charts, and among other things.

This windows app based on .net WinForms enable traders to watch their net liquidity (total equity) and its volatility on chart.
It alerts if certain gain threshold is achieved and prompt traders to actively take some profits off the table. 
The same applies if certain loss threshold is violated, then it prompts traders to actively cut losses.

Other features to be added is to auto close positions based on traders' settings and individual position analysis, such as 
percent gain/loss and alert traders to actively take profit/cut loss.
